# C++ Raylib Sprout Land

Tutorial from **Clear Code** in Python https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c

This project is similar to **Stardew Valley**.

### Dependencies

- Raylib  
  Main library to manage window, inputs, screen  
  Compile and install raylib https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
- Rygame  
  https://github.com/brccabral/rygame.git  
  I created this library to have my Raylib in the same style as Pygame.  
  Use as STATIC library.
- TMX  
  Parse `.tmx` files (**Tiled**)  
  Compile and install TMX https://github.com/baylej/tmx
- File `raylib-tmx.h` from https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-tmx  
  It contains helper functions to integrate TMX with Raylib.  
  Add this file to your include path.

### Resources

- Get game assets from tutorial project code https://github.com/clear-code-projects/PyDew-Valley
    - In `graphics/stumps`, I renamed the images to `Small.png` and `Large.png`.
